# ros2_ws_template

This repository serves as a template for all ROS2 workspaces to be created for the Rice Robotics Club. It features a basic scaffolding for the workspace, including src/ directory and a .gitignore to block build directories from being uploaded to the repository. It also features a .devcontainer setup that allows running packages in a Docker container that can be spun up by a simple command in VSCode.

## Running Devcontainer

After cloning repository and opening in VSCode, install the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension.
